Hi!😍 It's Aseza Mazondo here

Welcome to my page🙏

I was born in Eastern Cape one of Mthatha 
rural areas called Matheko. Growing up was 
not easy but I hanged in there, I did my 
Primary school in Lower Matheko JSS, high 
school in Nozuko HS and I did my varsity 
in Central University of Technology. After 
university studies I struggled getting a job.
Growing up i didn't participate in any sport
of which is not good when i look at it now.
